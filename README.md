# R2-D2 Astromech Project

This is the start of my journey of building an R2-D2 astromech.  I'm a member of the R2 Builders Club (https://astromech.net).  I've been lurking on the site since 2018.  I became aware of the group while attending Emerald City Comicon (ECCC) in Seattle.  

I've had an interest in robotics for a long while.  I got my first taste while in collage as a kid when tasked with fabricating and programing the hand for a larger class robot project.  

I had planned to begin with the dome as many do.  I ended up starting with the body because aluminum domes were not available.  I bought the HolmeMade frame with 2-3-2.  This is going to be an all aluminum build.  

I continue to gather parts.  There is a parts list that you can follow.  

I'll be using this repo for Python, Arduino, and any other code for the various systems that R2 has.  

*Update Jan 3rd 2022* -- Learned that one should really keep quiet on the Astromech.net forum.  I think I have a lot to offer but will likely not be starting a build thread based on some negative interaction.  

*Update Jan 10th 2022* -- I assembled my new utility arm housing.  That is an impresive kit.  I am missing a part and am waiting for a replacement to arive.  I think I'll get the utility arms powder coated prior to installing in the housing.  

*Update Jan 14th 2022* -- I installed the large data port (LDP). There was a little fiddling with the Holme frame to get it to fit.  The machined front upper frame ring needed some filing.  Also the spacer connecting the LDP shelf to that ring had the drilled and tapped holes just a bit off-center.  This required some clearancing with a course flat metal file.  It slides in well now.  It may be slightly too tall for the frame.  I'll probably get some washers to drop the shelf down a tiny bit so that the top of the LDP sits flush with the top of the frame.  

*Update Feb 24th 2022* -- I ordered the side plates for the Holmes frame  

*Update Dec 3rd 2022* -- The dome was ordered today  

*Update Jan 11th 2023* -- The dome has arrived.  Opening the box revealed minor damage to the outer dome.  I emailed about it and was advised to just work the metal back into place.  I have a background in auto body repair so this was easy.  I started cutting the pie pieces from the inner dome.

*Update Jan 16th 2023* -- My dome plan was to just check that it was received in good shape and them place in storage.  That didn't work out.  I've been tinkering.  Both domes have been cleaned of flashing.  I've cut out five pie pieces from the inner dome.  The outer dome is still uncut until I sand and polish.

Additional work was done on the body.  I used JBWeld ro attach the control arms to the utility arms.  The utility arm housing has been fitted to the front inner skin.  It shows that I'll need to open up the skin a little.  I was also able to mount the front power coupler.

*Update Jan 28th 2023* -- RSeries lighting arived.  I'll be assembling these into Philips surrounds tomorrow.  

*Update Jan 28th 2023* -- I assembled the RSeries lights today.  The rear logic with the curved surrount was a real PITA.  Getting those fibers in place was a big job.  They look great.  

*Update Jul 20th 2024* -- I installed the legs on R2 after modding for 2-3-2.  

*Update Jul 23th 2024* -- I ordered the wrong booster covers.  I emailed C8 to let them know.  

*Update Dec 26th 2024* -- Ordered ankle bracelets and center foot bracket.  

*Update Dec 24th 2025* -- I can't believe it's been a whole year and no update.  I've been working on other projects around the house and a couple car projects.  I'll start with the dome sanding.  I'm going to build a PVC stand today.  

*Update Jan 5th 2026* -- It's a new year.  I've been working on the dome.  I have the alignment finallized.  Three HPs are instaled along with the radar eye.  Next up - sanding.  So fun.  I ordered the wheel motor controller.  

*Update Jan 20th 2026* -- I'm assembling my Rlogic logic displays.  Assembly is going well except that I need some additional 4-40 fasteners for the aluminum bezels.  I'll try to pick up some tomorrow.

*Update Jan 21th 2026* -- I finished the front logic displays.  They look great.  The black fiber guides are fragile.  I broke a piece but it will work fine.

*Update Jan 27th 2026* -- Worked with a small flat file to open up dome for logics.  They fit.

*Update Jan 28th 2026* -- Begin dome sanding.
