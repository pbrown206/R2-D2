# R2-D2 Astromech Project

This is the start of my journey of building an R2-D2 astromech.  I'm a member of the R2 Builders Club (https://astromech.net).  I've been lurking on the site since 2018.  I became aware of the group while attending Emerald City Comicon (ECCC) in Seattle.  

I've had an interest in robotics for a long while.  I got my first taste while in collage as a kid when tasks with fabricating and programing the hand for a larger class robot project.  

I had planned to begin with the dome as many do.  I ended up starting with the body because aliminum domes were not available.  I bought the HolmeMade frame with 3-2-3.  This is going to be an all aluminum build.    

I continue to gather parts.  There is a parts list that you can follow.  

I'll be using this repo for Python, Arduino, and any other code for the various systems that R2 has.
